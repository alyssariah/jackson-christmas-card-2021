Our Golden Irish puppy River has now fully grown into a 55-lb stubborn, wild, goose-chasing, fun-loving, and attention-demanding adolescent puppy who is well on her way to passing her AKC Canine Good Citizen test next year. While our plan was to stay in Pittsburgh this summer, Brian was recruited by an autonomous vehicle company in Boston to intern as a domain expert for their motion planning team, so we spent a few (expensive) weeks in Boston where we got to meet up with friends, eat amazing food, and Brian got to implement his research on a real autonomous vehicle. Boston was amazing, but we still love our home in Pittsburgh. While we thought that was all the excitement we\u2019d get this year, around Thanksgiving an unexpected job opportunity came up and Alyssa decided to leave SAE to work as the first full-time software developer for a startup working on building the augmented reality layer of metaverse.
