the growth that\n            sprouts from uprooted plans. We’re still loving our lives in\n            Pittsburgh, while Brian inches closer to finishing his PhD in\n            Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University and Alyssa has launched into\n            her career as a Software Developer at SAE, International. Our Golden\n            Irish puppy River has now fully grown into a 55-lb stubborn, wild,\n            goose-chasing, fun-loving, and attention-demanding adolescent puppy\n            who is well on her way to passing her AKC Canine Good Citizen test\n            next year. While our plan was to stay in Pittsburgh this summer,\n            Brian was recruited by an autonomous vehicle company in Boston to\n            intern as a domain expert for their motion planning team, so we\n            spent a few (expensive) weeks in Boston where we got to meet up with\n            friends, eat amazing food, and Brian got to implement his research\n            on a real autonomous vehicle. Boston was amazing, but we still love\n            our home in Pittsburgh.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This year has really brought us closer together as a couple as we’ve\n            wrestled with questions surrounding future career plans, family\n            relationships, and religion. While many of those questions remained\n            unanswered, we’ve both found an incredible sense of gratitude for\n            what we do have, and for our relationship as a couple. We are\n            incredibly grateful for the many open, honest, and real\n            conversations we’ve had with friends and family, and for the depth\n            those conversations have added to those relationships. We hope that\n            this Holiday season brings you opportunities to build stronger\n            relationships with loved ones both near and far, and a renewed sense\n            of gratitude for the gift we each have of living each day.\n          </p>\n          {/* <div className=\"arrows-down\">\n            <i className=\"icon-down--small fas fa-chevron-down\"></i>\n            <i
